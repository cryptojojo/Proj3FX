The design of the elevator makes it impossible for people in the elevator to pass each other, &#10;but the elevator is very deep and can hold 20 people.  As such, in order for someone in the back (side furthest from the door) of the elevator to leave &#10;the elevator, everyone else in the elevator must first exist.  This is very inconvenient for the everyone involved.  Corporate has proposed that instead &#10;of everyone getting off and on the elevator every time someone in the back needs to get off the elevator, only the person at the front (nearest the &#10;door side) is allowed to get off the elevator.  (NOTE: If the first n people all want to get off at the current floor, they can.  But once the current &quot;top&quot; of &#10;the stack is a person who does NOT want to exit the elevator, no one else can exit the elevator at this time.)  Additionally, Corporate as dictated that on &#10;a given floor stop, all allowable &quot;pop&quot; operations must occur before any &quot;push&quot; operations. Management has also decided that they should get to select &#10;certain people (VIPs) who get to &quot;bypass&quot; the regular queue and get onto the elevators first!">
